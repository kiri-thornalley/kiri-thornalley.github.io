Hi, I'm Kiri!  If you've made it here, you've probably also got a copy of my academic CV. This website is currently intended to function as a complete, and significantly more interactive version of this. 
Down the left-hand sidebar, you'll find links to ORCID, GitHub, LinkedIn and my Goodreads profile as I can often be found with my head in a book. 
<br/>

My previous education includes a BSc (Hons) in Chemistry from the University of Sheffield, where I additionally took 40 credits of German in my first year, a Masters by Research in Chemistry at the University of York and a PhD in Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences at the University of Strathclyde. Through these experiences, I have learnt a wide range of skills, ranging from the expected wet-lab, analytical skills, through to the use of machine learning in the design and development of microfluidic devices to study pharmaceutically relevent phenomena _in vivo_, without the need for animal-based experimentation. 
<br/>
As a passionate advocate for Equity, Diversity and Inclusion, I fundamentally believe that Science can and should be for everyone.
<br/>

My research interests include:
<ul>
* Small molecule synthesis for medicinal purposes<br/>
* Developing novel analytical methods <br/>
* Machine Learning and Artificial Intellegence to enhance decision making <br/>
* Laboratory automation and "self-driving laboratories" <br/>
</ul>
