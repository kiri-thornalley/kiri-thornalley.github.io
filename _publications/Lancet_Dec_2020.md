### Abstract
Visibility creates a crucial sense of individual belonging and security for LGBTQ+ people, and those who are able to be open about their sexuality and gender can serve as role models for the wider community. Visible or not, LGBTQ+ people frequently encounter societal or legal discrimination, particularly in countries that retain colonial-era legislation. One of the aims of The STEM Village Virtual Symposium, which took place in August, 2020, was to increase visibility of LGBTQ+ individuals in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) community. More than 700 attendees participated, including from countries where it is dangerous or illegal to be openly LGBTQ+. We received feedback from people in these regions that events such as the symposium helped them to feel hopeful and part of a wider community.
